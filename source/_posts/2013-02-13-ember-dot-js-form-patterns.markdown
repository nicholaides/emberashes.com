On Jan 24th, 2013, I gave a lightning talk at [Ember.js NYC][emberjs-nyc] where I built a small [Ember.js app][repo] demonstrating the solution to some common problems with forms that arrise in Ember.js.

In [this repo][repo], each commit is specifically crafted to demonstrate one step in the process. Looking through the [commit log][commit-log] will give you a good idea of how each feature is implemented.
